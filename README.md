# customer-churn-prediction
Customer churn prediction using Logistic Regression

# Project Overview
This project predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to churn (leave the service) using customer demographic and service usage data.

# Dataset
Telecom customer dataset containing information such as tenure, contract type, monthly charges, and customer status.

# Steps Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature encoding
- Logistic Regression model building
- Model evaluation using Accuracy, Recall, and ROC-AUC

# Model Used
- Logistic Regression

# Results
- Accuracy: 81%
- Recall: 63%
- ROC-AUC: 0.87

# Business Insights
- Customers with short tenure are more likely to churn
- Month-to-month contracts have higher churn
- Higher monthly charges increase churn risk

# Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
